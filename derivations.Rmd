##Microeconomics I, Session 3
#Problem 1
You have been asked to analyze the market for steel. From public sources, you are able to find that last year's price for steel was $20$ USD per ton. At this price, $100$ million tons were sold on the world market. From trade association data, you are able to obtain estimates for their own price elasticities of demand and supply on the world markets $-0.25$ for demand and $+0.5$ for supply. Assume the steel has linear demand and supply curves throughout.

**Part A.** Solve for the equations of demand and supply in this market, and sketch the demand and supply curves.
